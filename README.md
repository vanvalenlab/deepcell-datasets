[![Actions Status](https://github.com/vanvalenlab/deepcell-datasets/workflows/Test%20API/badge.svg)](https://github.com/vanvalenlab/deepcell-datasets/actions)

DeepCell Datasets is a collection of data engineering and versioning tools for the management of optical microscopy images and its associated metadata. This Master Data Management allows for a single entry point for access to the lab's raw data and provides to means to pair them with crowdsourced annotations to create custom training data for [DeepCell](https://github.com/vanvalenlab/deepcell-tf).

## Getting Started

DeepCell Datasets uses a serverless architecture with a static webpage consuming several services.
This is aided by using `lectra` as well as the `serverless` framework.
`lerna` enables us to easily control all of the services from the root directory, while `serverless` allows us to deploy and manage AWS infrastructure through `.yml` configuration files.

### Deployment

```bash
yarn deploy:dev
# yarn deploy:prod
```
